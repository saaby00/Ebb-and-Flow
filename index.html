<blockquote>
<p>This article by John Allsopp explains web design in both philosophical and literal terms. He first describes Daoism, which is essentially a philosophy that relates to a person’s overall connection with themselves and their surroundings. Web design relates to this philosophy because it works as the link connecting that connects people to ideas. Allsopp explains that the web is constantly evolving and adapting to its surroundings as a sort of new-old medium. Here, he provides the example of television as an innovation that evolved from the radio; it is just the radio, but this time with visuals. This is what the web is to printed media; it is printed media, but in a digital format. Still, the web evolves into its own with the languages of web design, as websites should be adaptable for viewers. The function of the site ultimately becomes more important than the form, though form should still be considered.This is another point where the philosophy comes into play with the idea of “ebb and flow.” With web design, designers must be able to create layouts and utilize fonts, by employing percentages using stylesheets and markdown. So, there is no set number of points or picas that determines the layout of a site, and there is no universal font size; everything works proportionally and is determined by set percentages so that the layout works on mobile and desktop. Allsopp also makes a note of color, stating that it is important, but should not overtake the overall design of a site. </p>
